# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Panashe Matarutse  

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm someone who loves learning and building things that
(hopefully) make a difference. .

## ðŸš€ABout Me

I started in civil engineering and architecture but found myself captivated by
coding and technology. Now, Iâ€™m exploring how to bring ideas to life with
Python, JavaScript, and a bit of creativity.

## ðŸŒ± What Iâ€™m Working On

- Small projects that solve real-world problems  
- Learning as I go and sharing what I can
